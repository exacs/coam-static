    <h1>Open Calls</h1>

    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>Well constructed essays than engage with the problematization of the concept of Anthology, whether confronting two opposite discourses, analyzing the structure of previous compilations or discussing the procedures of architectural ideas dissemination. We expect interpretive work that draws new relations between things. The most basic form of this type of manuscript should present a thesis, back it up with arguments in the supporting body paragraphs and then bring the paper to a conclusion.</p>
    <p>Papers should be 5.000 words length and must be written in English and will be preceded by a 300 words Abstract. Peer reviewing will be carried out in two phases.<br>
    Abstract Deadline: 8 November 2017<br>
    Full-paper Deadline: 1 December 2017<br>
    Length: 2.500 words max.</p>
